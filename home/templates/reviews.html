      <p>I bought a classic car from Megan’s Antiques. I was viewing this particular car for around 6 months and decided to go ahead and buy it. I had several phone conversations with the ‘Cars’ department about the car, they went over all specifications,
        faults and mechanical information. </p>

      <p>I purchased an old-fashioned wooden car for my son from Megan’s Antiques; I am very impressed with the quality of the item. The toy is as stated on the website and exceeds my son’s expectations! The delivery was quick and did not cost a fortune!
        Very pleased with the toy car and will defiantly be using this site again!</p>
