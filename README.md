# Megan's Antiques

In this project i have built a full-stack site based around business and logic used to control a centrally-owned dataset. This is an ecommerce site that allows users to purchase antiques
from the site. I decided not to use the project ideas and to create a website which sells antiques instead. I thought this kind of site would be a good way of showing the skills i have
gained throughout the course. I have used HTML and CSS for the front end design off the project as well as Bootstrap and Font Awsome to contribute to the design of each page. i have done
a lot of research on antique websites to see what the main products that are sold, the design off an antique website such as colour schemes, fonts and layouts.
