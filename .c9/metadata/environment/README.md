This is an ecommerce site that allows users to purchase antiques\nfrom the site. I decided not to use the project ideas and to create a website which sells antiques instead. I thought this kind of site would be a good way of showing the skills i have\ngained throughout the course. I have used HTML and CSS for the front end design off the project as well as Bootstrap and Font Awsome to contribute to the design of each page. I have used\nstripe payments for the purchasing part of the site and Python, Django and JavaScript for the back end of the website. When creating the design off the website i decided to research colour\nschemes on the internet and i ended up going for a grey/beige/cream with hints of dark blue for the colour scheme. I thought these colours worked well together and made the site gender-neutrual.\nI also thought with the decision i made on the colour scheme would attract a wider range of audience. I have used pages such as support, terms of use and about us to give the user a lot of\ninformation about the business and also give the user the option to get in touch through forms, email and telephone. I also have researched pages such as terms and conditions so i understood\nwhat was needed for my website. I have tried to make the website easy to navigate and clear to read as i thought accessbility of the site was very important. I also have used responsiveness\nthroughout the website so the site is easy to access and navigate regardless on the screen size. I have used the same button and font styles throughout the site to keep the design of the website\nthe same throughout each page. I have done a lot of research on antique websites to see what the main products that are sold, the design off an antique website such as colour schemes, fonts and\nlayouts. When doing the research for this project i realised there was a wide range of products i could choose. I decided to narrow it down to products i thought were most likely to sell\nsuch as antique funiture and toys. I have also created a logo for the site with the same colour scheme so all components of the site work well together. I have create a page with all products\nand then seperate pages for each category of products. I have 6 different categories, Art, Clocks, Classic Cars, Furniture, Jewellery and Toys. Each product is labeled with a title, a cover image,\na description of the product and a price. If you click on the title of the product it will divert you to the single product page where there is more images and a more in-depth description of the\nproduct. I decided to dedicate the website to only old products. I did some research on what is most likely to sell from a website rather than a store. I\nrealised there was a few categories that all around the world people are interested in such as antique furniture and toys. I also found that one of the biggest viewing categories is classic cars.\nI know selling a car to a piece of a furniture is very different but I choose to add cars to the website to attract a wider audience.\n\n\n## UX\n\nI decided to create this website with the intended audience of adults aged 18+. This website is aimed at both men and women and available to everyone who can access the web. This website will be\nused for browsing old antiques, purchasing them and having them delivered straight to your home. Most users will aready know what they want, so i created category pages, a search bar and buttons\nto pages on the home page for easy navigation.\n\n* If a user wanted to contact us regarding a damaged product - the user can go to the bottom of any page, find the footer and click on the link 'Support'. This will then redirect the user to the \nsupport page where they can fill out a form. They will need to type their email in, choose the category 'damages' from the dropdown and then write a description of the damaged product in the \ntext field. Then the user will need to press the submit button and wait for a response from one of the customer service team.\n\n* If a user wanted to contact us regarding a late delivery - the user can go to the bottom of any page, find the footer and click on the link 'Support'. This will then redirect the user to the \nsupport page where they can fill out a form. They will need to type their email in, choose the category 'delivery' from the dropdown and then write a description of the late delivery in the \ntext field. Then the user will need to press the submit button and wait for a response from one of the customer service team.\n\n* If a user wanted to contact us regarding returning a product - the user can go to the bottom of any page, find the footer and click on the link 'Support'. This will then redirect the user to the \nsupport page where they can fill out a form.

Then the user will need to press the submit button and wait for a response from one of the customer service team.\n\n* If a user wanted to contact us regarding an order - the user can go to the bottom of any page, find the footer and click on the link 'Support'. This will then redirect the user to the \nsupport page where they can fill out a form.
